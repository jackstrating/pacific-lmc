                <h2> The Yurts at the Pacific Trails</h2>
                <dt><strong> What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
                    ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
                    roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

                <dt><strong>How are yurts furnished?</strong></dt>

                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                    quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience
                    also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
                    running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located
                    in the lodge.

                <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>

                <dd>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most
                    guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
                    dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</dd>
